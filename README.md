Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a recommender system using Matrix Factorization with PyTorch. The system takes movie ratings as input and generates a full recommendation matrix that can be used to predict the top movies for each user.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd <your_repo_directory>
2. Install Dependencies
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare Data
Download the dataset from MovieLens 1M dataset or any other dataset with the columns: userId, movieId, and rating. Place the ratings.csv file in the data/ml-latest-small/ folder.

Running the Project
To train the model and get the final recommendation matrix, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The model will be trained for 50 epochs by default, and after training, the final recommendation matrix will be printed.

How the Final Matrix Can Be Used for Predictions
The final recommendation matrix generated by the model is a user-item matrix where each entry represents the predicted rating of a movie for a specific user.

Matrix Explanation:
Each row represents a user.
Each column represents a movie.
The value at position (i, j) in the matrix indicates the predicted rating of the movie j by user i.
Making Predictions:
To predict the top movies for a user, you can look at the user's corresponding row in the final matrix. The movies with the highest predicted ratings are the ones that the user is most likely to enjoy but hasn't rated yet.

Example:
To recommend the top 5 movies for a specific user (e.g., user 0), you can use the following code:

python
Copy code
user_id = 0
top_movie_indices = np.argsort(final_matrix[user_id])[::-1][:5]
print("Top 5 movies for user 0:")
for idx in top_movie_indices:
    print(movie_names[idx])  # You should have a mapping of movie indices to movie names
This will output the top 5 movies for user 0 based on the predicted ratings.
